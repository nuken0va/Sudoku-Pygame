# Sudoku
This is a simple sudoku program written in Python using Pygame. I made this project just for fun.

Here is some screenshots:

Currently puzzle generating algorithm is rather primitive so the game can freeze for 1-2 seconds when rerolling the puzzle. Maybe I'll fix it in the future by implementing another algorithm.

## Features:

+ Random puzzle generation
+ Custom UI system
+ Candidates (aka marks)
+ Undo/Redo stacks
+ Different solving techniques available through hints
+ Auto Candidate Mode
+ Values and candidates highlight
